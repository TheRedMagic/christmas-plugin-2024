# PlayTest Notes:

### PLAYTEST BUGS:

- Spectate point on bauble tag is not mapped properly (after being eliminated)
- chat validation error
- Streamline game overviews to be the same durationg
    - paintwars overview a bit too long
    - BaubleTag too short

- sled racing broken, can leave boats
    - add two passengers to sled racing?
- sled racing only do one lap

Lag related:

- lag spike with donation events when submitted.
- see issues of server lagging

Things to absolutely check for next 'playtest'

- Avalanche spectators should no longer be able to attack each other
- visual indication of double jump in block party.
- spleef non opped players cant break blocks.
- Real donations are rounding properly.
- try and get team to desecrate the tree in tree decorating to patch any oversights
